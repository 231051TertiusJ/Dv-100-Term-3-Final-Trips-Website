## Queen Anne's Pardon A DV 100 Project

### DV 100 Final Submission ReadMe 

In this ReadMe file we will explore the process of my Term 3 DV Project and the scenes of lamentation it caused. :)





## Introduction/ About the project

In this Project we were instructed to create a dynamic website through JQuery.
We explored animations, javascript fundamentals, and other data interactions. We used the JQuery library to improve and manipulate the DOM following the brief.

If i am being honest this term was extremely challenging for me as i found it hard to understand the JQuery code, it also did not help that i did not book a contact session and focused more on other subjects as there were complications because of the submissions. The struggles were real and as i coded Queen Anne's Pardon i longed to be on the very beaches i was coding about. So without futher ado lets start the ReadMe file.
