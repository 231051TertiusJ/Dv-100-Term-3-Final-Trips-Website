## Queen Anne's Pardon A DV 100 Project

## DV 100 Final Submission ReadMe 

In this ReadMe file we will explore the process of my Term 3 DV Project and the scenes of lamentation it caused. :)





## Introduction/ About the project

Anne's Pardon is a Caribbean placed holiday cruise website that allow the users to book trips within the beautiful Caribbean sea and sail as pirates once did. It features fun facts, helpful weather information and an handy filter to find what you want to find. 

In this Project we were instructed to create a dynamic website through JQuery.
We explored animations, javascript fundamentals, and other data interactions. We used the JQuery library to improve and manipulate the DOM following the brief.

If i am being honest this term was extremely challenging for me as i found it hard to understand the JQuery code, it also did not help that i did not book a contact session and focused more on other subjects as there were complications because of the submissions. The struggles were real and as i coded Queen Anne's Pardon i longed to be on the very beaches i was coding about. So without futher ado lets start the ReadMe file.
